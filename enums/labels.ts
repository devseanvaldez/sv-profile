      "Hi, I'm Sean. In 2020, I started as a junior-level developer at a logistics company in the Philippines. I contributed to in-house projects such as logistics dashboards that integrated GPS and Google Maps with our backend services, providing real-time data via sockets. During a brief period on Upwork, I also gained experience building websites for businesses, including a travel agency app used in the UAE. This experience enabled me to redesign legacy websites into modern React/NextJS applications that incorporate new features and functionalities tailored to client requirements.",
      "The primary technologies I use include ReactJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, and Git. I also work with libraries such as Redux Toolkit and Axios, and UI frameworks like Material-UI and Reactstrap, among others.",
      "I continuously hone my skills and possess strong problem-solving abilities. I ensure that my code is optimized and passes performance tests, frequently using Lighthouse to identify and address performance bottlenecks.",
      "Effective communication is essential to me, as it helps ensure that I understand task requirements efficiently.",

    research:
      "I strive to be flexible, adaptable, and capable of leveraging modern technologies to effectively support my teams. The design world is evolving rapidly, especially in UI/UX, so it's essential for a modern designer to have at least a basic understanding of how to specify components for contemporary UI libraries and frameworks.",
